# Data Science Job Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to data science job listings. The analysis includes data understanding, preparation, descriptive statistics, salary analysis, job role exploration, company insights, and outlier detection.

## Project Structure

### Data Understanding & Preparation
- Utilize Pandas to load and inspect the dataset, checking its shape, data types, and missing values.
- Summarize features in a table and address any missing data.

### Descriptive Statistics
- Compute mean, median, range, and standard deviation for numerical features.
- Visualize distributions through histograms, boxplots, or density plots.
- For categorical features, count unique values and frequencies, and visualize distributions using bar plots or pie charts.

### Salary Analysis
- Create a histogram of the Salary to assess skewness.
- Generate a heatmap to show correlations between salary and other features.
- Use scatterplots to examine relationships such as Salary vs. Experience or Location.
- Group data by Job Role or Company and plot average salary.

### Job Role Exploration
- Employ pair plots or scatter matrices to investigate interactions between job roles and other features.
- Use boxplots to compare average salaries across different job roles.

### Company Insights
- Rank companies by average salary and visualize with a horizontal bar chart.
- Identify companies with the most job listings and examine if larger companies offer higher salaries.

### Outlier Detection
- Detect job listings with extreme values and investigate whether these outliers are valid or errors.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Data_Science_Job_EDA.ipynb` to perform the analysis.

## Requirements
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the characteristics of data science job listings, salary trends, and differences between job roles and companies. It also highlights the importance of various features in determining job salaries.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to reveal patterns and insights within a dataset of data science job listings. The analysis highlights key trends in job roles, company offerings, and salary distributions. These findings provide a solid foundation for further analysis or the development of predictive models to estimate job salaries based on various features.

## Further Analysis
- Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict job salaries based on various features.
- Time Series Analysis: Perform a more detailed time series analysis to understand trends in job listings over time.
- Role-Specific Analysis: Conduct separate analyses for different job roles to uncover unique patterns and trends within each role.
- Company Impact: Investigate the impact of company size and industry on job salaries.
- Advanced NLP Techniques: Use advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze job descriptions and requirements.
- Geographic Analysis: Analyze geographic patterns to understand how location influences job salaries and availability.
